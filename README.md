<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Background Information</h2>
<body> 
<p>My name is Steph, I’m 34 years old, my husband & I have been married for 18 months, and we have a 7-year-old gold sable East German working line German Shepherd named Aris, pictured.
I have two siblings, a younger brother named Josh who I’m super close to, and an older sister. </p>

<p>My Dad was in the Air Force for 21 years, so we moved around when I was growing up. As a result of my Dad’s postings, my sister was born in Malaysia, my brother was born in Victoria, I was born in South Australia, and when I was 8 we moved to Queensland.</p>
<p>In terms of hobbies and interests, I collect brooches, I love reading & musical theatre, and I’m very interested in both domestic & international politics. My husband and I also love to travel, on our most recent trip, we went to the United States for our honeymoon last year where we attended a concert at Opry House in Nashville & toured Graceland in Memphis. I’m also a massive country music fan & Elvis Presley tragic.</p>
<p>I work for QGC, formerly an Australian owned company that is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Australia. I’ve been with QGC for nearly 12 years in various roles across several business units, including Corporate Receptionist, Team Administrator to the Engineering Team & Management Assistant to the Manager Access.</p>
<p>Currently I work as the Land Systems & Process Advisor, still within the Access Department. As part of this role, I work closely with IT to improve our systems and fix them when required, and through my work, it has become increasingly apparent to me that IT is where I’d like to head with my career in the long term.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>

<p>My IT experience has been, for the most part, gained over the past 2 years through my current role at work. </p>
<p>Since taking up the role of Land Systems & Process Advisor I’ve been involved several projects, including the migration of my teams SharePoint site collection, our shared drive folders. I also administer the SharePoint site collection for my team on an ongoing basis, and act as administrator for several internal applications which include, LAARs which is QGC’s bespoke land access permitting system, Quorum, which is our land management software & our stakeholder management system. I’m also the Information Management Compliance focal point for my team, which includes the rollout of Shells Global Records Management process for my team. </p>
<p>I’m still figuring out exactly which direction I’d like to go with my career in IT, but my interest lies in the areas of cloud computing, web design, communication & ethics.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>I decided to study through OUA & RMIT, because of the flexibility that online learning affords me, given I work fulltime and have other additional responsibilities to manage.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
<p>During my studies with RMIT I hope to build on the skills and knowledge I’ve gained at work, by learning about IT concepts in more detail. I intend to use the skills I learn, and the knowledge I gain through my study to assist in the advancement of my career at Shell.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Role Overview</h2>
<p>The role is a full-time employee position with a company specialising in the roll out of Microsoft cloud-based computing solutions for organisations looking to transition to a more flexible dynamic way of working. The role will involve building a team who will assist in the delivery of a pipeline of major projects over the next 2 years.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Why does this role appeal to you?</h2>
<p>This position appeals to me for quite a few reasons, not least of which is the fact that it is a very client focussed role. I love to deal with people, I have a very outgoing, bubbly personality and because of this, I find that people really respond well to me. I also love that this role has a focus on cloud-based computing and, the Microsoft Collaboration Suite as it is a platform that I use daily and love to use.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Role Requirements</h2>
<p>The role will require a candidate with stakeholder facing project-based experience and hands on enterprise project experience with the Microsoft Collaboration Suite in a senior role. The role also requires experience with building complex workflows across SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Power Apps & the use of Bots. Further technical experience is required with the Microsoft Collaboration Suite, including Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, SharePoint Online, Azure & Office 365.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">A description of your current skills, qualification & experience</h2>
<p>Through my current role, I’ve gained experience with SharePoint Online, primarily in terms of administration, building site collections, sub-sites and the provision of end user support. I also have experience with Office 365 as an end user as this is used at my current place of work. I’ve also had limited exposure to the Azure platform as the Permitting system I administer is an Azure SQL Database. I also have excellent interpersonal and communication skills, and an extensive background in stakeholder engagement which will contribute to my success in the role of Modern Workplace Consultant, specialising in the Microsoft Collaboration Suite. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">How will you obtain the skills, qualification & experience required for the role?</h2>
<p>To obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position described above, I intend to continue with my university studies, focussing on cloud-based computing & project management. I will look for appropriate development opportunities at work where possible, including work-based courses & appropriate work experience within the relevant teams within Shell where possible. 
This strategy coupled with the research & work I complete in my own time I believe, will allow me to not only be successful in the role of Modern Workplace Consultant described above, but to excel in this role.</p>
<h1 style="font-family:calibri;">Personal Profile</h1>
<p>As per the assignment outline, I completed a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, a learning styles test and for the third test, I completed a creativity test. I’ve included commentary on each of the tests below.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
<p>For me, both the MBTI test & the learning style test are highly accurate, both tests confirmed what I already knew. I’m a very visual learner, I need to see read information to retain it or be shown how to do something to carry out a task successfully.  The MBTI test indicates to me that perhaps I’m too modest in some scenarios and could benefit from being a little more confident in terms of my skills and abilities. Based on my recent experience, I would benefit from being more confident in work scenarios so that others don’t take credit for my work and ideas. From the results of the creativity test, I’ve learned that in terms of overall creativity, my score is below the typical score. The results also indicate to me that I’m able to make connections between things that don’t appear to a connection at first glance. Although I’ve scored outside of the norm for the persistence metric, to me this suggests that I keep looking for solutions even though good ones have already been identified. This could be problematic as I may be spending time working on problems that already have solutions, and therefore wasting my time, and that of potential team members.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>Based on my test results, I intend to work on being more assertive when I’m working in a team, specifically I will speak up more so that my ideas and opinions are heard. I will also work on taking ownership of my ideas so that I am given the credit I deserve for my contributions. I realise that I have a talent for ensuring things run smoothly so I will continue to use this to my advantage and that for the benefit of my entire team. I will also make it known to my team members that I am a visual learner and therefore, to understand a task and complete it properly, I really need to be shown how to complete a task, rather than simply talking about it. I will also work to ensure that once I’ve completed a task, I won’t second guess myself and look for better solutions when good solutions have already been identified.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>Based on the knowledge I’ve gained by completing the MBTI test, the learning styles test and the creativity test, I intend to look for people whose personalities complement my own. I will also look for people whose skills and learning styles complement my own. Ideally, I’d be looking to work with someone who is able to lead a group, and who is more assertive than I am, but is able to ensure that all team members feel included & part of the team. I’d also be looking to work with people who have a strong ability to illustrate their point visually, either by writing something down or demonstrating their point using diagrams or other visual aids.</p>
<h1 style="font-family:calibri;">Project Idea</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Overview</h2>
<p>My ideal job has a requirement for experience using bots within the Microsoft Collaboration Suite, so for my project I intend to create a chatbot. The chatbot will be built into a SharePoint site that I am currently in the process of updating at work. As part of this project, I will create a list of administration questions that I am frequently asked by members of my team, and the answers to those questions. The chatbot will be set up to answer these administration related questions.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Motivation</h2>
<p>Up until 2 and a half years ago, I was a career Administrator so I was constantly approached by members of my team, and those from other areas of the business I currently work in, for help with everything from applying for a corporate credit card to lodging an IT request.</p> 
<p>Since moving out of Administration, into my current role as Land Systems & Process Advisor, one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced has been people’s inability to stop for help with certain things. Throughout the transition out of my administration role, one of the biggest drains on my time has been having answer people’s administration related questions. I’m hoping that being able to direct people to my chatbot will free up my time so that I can focus on my current role.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Description</h2>
<p>According to the 2018 Deloitte Millennial Survey, the three most important criteria that millennials look for in a new employer are pay (51%), culture (57%) & flexibility (44%) [1].</P>
<p>It is this requirement for flexibility that is driving the move to more collaborative cloud-based computing solutions and the company I work for is no exception. As part of this shift, my workplace has moved to a dynamic desking model, along with changes to our way of working that includes the use of tools like OneDrive, Office365 and SharePoint Online. These tools allow for more online collaboration between teams and workers, regardless of whether an individual is in the office, at one of our Western Queensland locations, or working from home.</p>
<p>To that end, as part of my current duties, I am working to improve our SharePoint Online site collection to ensure greater take up of this tool by my team. As part of this process, I have decided to create a chatbot that will be able to answer administration questions from team members which will free up more of my time for tasks that are within my current remit.</p>
<p>The chatbot I intend to create will be available to all users within my team from our SharePoint Online homepage, and will be able to answer a range of questions related to general administration, including, but not limited to, completing expenses, lodging IT requests, sending & receiving mail, how to order PPE and how to book travel.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Tools & Technologies</h2>
<p>Azure is the basis for the SharePoint Online and other Microsoft based tools used in my workplace, so I intend to use it as the basis for my chatbot. Along with the technology I will use to create my bot, I will engage with my team to ensure that my chatbot will be answering questions relevant to them and their roles.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the tools & resources I will use throughout the process of creating of my chatbot</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>Microsoft Learn modules: Azure Fundamentals, Build an FAQ chatbot with QnA Maker & Azure Bot Service and Create Intelligent Bots with the Azure Bot Service.</li>
<li>Microsoft Bot Framework</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure Account</li> 
<li>Microsoft Azure Bot Service</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure QnA Maker</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure YouTube Channel</li>
<li>Chat Bots Magazine</li>
<li>SharePoint Online</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Skills Required</h2>
<p>I will need a better understanding of exactly how bots work, how to write code to create a bot, how to integrate my chatbot into SharePoint Online and how to ensure seamless conversational interaction between the end user and the chatbot.</p>
<p>To build my chatbot I will need to learn to use QnA, the Azure Bot Service, how to create a QnA knowledge base, test it and publish it. I will also need to learn how to integrate my QnA knowledge base with a bot and then test my bot via the Azure portal.[2]</p>
<p>Additional skills I would like to learn as part of the process of creating my bot include how to write JavaScript, and the concepts needed to create a bot capable of learning.</p>
<p>I believe it will be feasible to find the resources I need to create my chatbot and identify the relevant skills, however I’m not sure it will be feasible to learn the skills I need to learn within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:calibri;">Outcome</h2>
<p>If I can successfully create a bot capable of answering administration related questions from my team, my team members won’t need to wait for me to respond to emails or Skype messages and I will have more time to spend on duties related to my current role and other professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>If successful, the creation of my chatbot could have far reaching implications for the wider QGC business in that personnel would be able to find the answers to questions without having to bother someone else in their team, or another part of the business.</p>
<p>The chatbot concept could also be replicated by functions other than Administration, for example, it could be rolled out within the IT space for frequently asked questions, thereby freeing up IT resources.</p>
