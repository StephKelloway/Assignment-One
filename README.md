  <h2>Background Information</h2>
<body> 
<p>I live in the western suburbs of Brisbane with my husband of 18 months, and our gold sable East German working line German Shepherd named Aris. I have two siblings, a younger brother named Josh who I'm very close to, and an older sister.</p>
<p>My dad was in the Air Force for 21 years, so we moved around when I was growing up, as a result, I’ve lived in South Australia, Victoria and for the last 26 years, Queensland.</p>
<p>Something I find interesting about myself, and that surprises a lot of people is the fact that I have Narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness. Due to a deficiency in my brain of a neurotransmitters called orexins, my bodys ability to regulate my sleep patterns and my ability to stay awake is significantly diminished. Narcolepsy is thought to be an autoimmune disorder that affects roughly 12,000 people in Australia, making it rare.</p>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, singing, spending time with my family and friends, walking adventures with my husband and our dog & listening to podcasts.</P>
<p>I work for QGC, formerly an Australian company, that is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Australia. I’ve been with QGC for nearly 12 years in various roles across several business units, including Corporate Receptionist, Team Administrator to the Engineering Team & Management Assistant to the Manager Access.</P>

<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
<body>
<p>My IT experience has been, for the most part, gained over the past 2 years through my current role at work. </p>
<p>Currently I work as the Land Systems & Process Advisor, still within the Access Department. As part of this role, I work closely with IT, and through my work, it has become increasingly apparent to me that IT is where I’d like to head with my career in the long term.</p>
<p> Since taking up the role of Land Systems & Process Advisor I’ve been involved several projects, including the migration of my teams SharePoint site collection, our shared drive folders. I also administer the SharePoint site collection for my team on an ongoing basis, and act as administrator for several internal applications which include, LAARs which is QGC’s bespoke land access permitting system, Quorum, which is our land management software & our stakeholder management system. </p>
<p>I’m also the Information Management Compliance focal point for my team, which includes the rollout of Shells Global Records Management process for my team.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<body>
<p>I decided to study through OUA & RMIT, because of the flexibility that online learning affords me, given I work fulltime and have other additional responsibilities.</p>
<p>More specifically, I chose RMIT because of the reputation it has as a leader in Information Technology, I base this opinion on my own research, conducted prior to signing up with OUA and RMIT.</P>
</body>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<body>
<p>Through my studies with RMIT, I hope to build on the skills and knowledge I’ve gained at work by learning about technical IT concepts in more detail.</p>
<p>My interest in IT lies in the areas of communications and ethics, specifically related to social media, cloud computing & project management.</p>
